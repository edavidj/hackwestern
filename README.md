# Our Project
* This was our hack for the fourth ever HackWestern event.
* Our vision was to create a web app that would use indico's machine learning API to give yelp users
a personality type based their reviews, and in turn recommend them restaurants based on their personality type.
#The Tech Stack
* We made this project using node/express for the back end, indico for text analysis, and semantic ui for the front end.
#Help
* This app was completed in a rush and with a small data set, if you are interested in testing it feel free to use a name from these examples
** Joe, Mary, Katherine, J, King
#Further Development
* Due to underwhelming progress and limited use cases we will not continue development of this application.
